# Python-page-refresher

So this project is a page refresher I made using Python


<h3>If you are using chrome</h3>

<p>Install chromedriver based on your chrome version on https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads</p>
<p>To find your chrome version click on the three dots on the top right corner of the screen in your chrome window</p>
<p>Hover over help and click on about chrome</p>
<p>This will direct you to the 'about chrome' page</p>
<p>You should see your chrome version on the screen</p>

<h3>If you are using Firefox</h3>

First install GeckoDriver from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
Replace where it says "Chrome" with Firefox. 
Then in the brackets replace the path of chromedriver to th epath of gecko driver.
